## Background
Foundation is a library providing an interface over a set of cloud hosted services. The library and the services combined form the Connected Spaces Platform and afford client application developers across a range of language and platforms with a means to build cross-reality, multi-user, interactive applications. Those applications then enable users to interact with either pre-authored content baked into the application, or user-generated content delivered on the fly.
